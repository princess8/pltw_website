    <p> Hello my name is Princess. This is my first time making a website using html.</p>  
    <p> The class I am in is teaching us how to make this. 
    Honestly though I have no clue about anything having to do with html. 
   <p> Though I do know of python as I have a computer and have used pyhton to do the oh so common Hello World.    </p>
    <p> I am from Los Angeles though my parents moved to Bakersfield and brought me along. </p>
    <p>There isn't much to say about me though I am thinking that learning html in this class will be useful.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p> Have fun playing a game that I recently played and enjoyed. Advice: Don't let the white trap you.</p>
    <p>I have a great interest in pianos and I would like to have one of my own.</p>
    <p>Though I have been learning how to play I don't really have the time right now.</p>
